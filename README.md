### what does it do exactly
if the example video wasnt enough, it basically generates and stitches frames for a slideshow/compilation video using PIL and FFmpeg.

### how to use
1. Make sure you have FFmpeg, Python and necessary modules.

   Windows: double click the setup.bat

   Linux: ``chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`` (or just double click the setup script)
2. Run main.py and it should Just Work(tm)
